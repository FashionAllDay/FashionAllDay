                <h2>What Is Streetwear?</h2>
                <p class="post-intro">
                    Streetwear originated from the skate and hip-hop scenes, drawing inspiration from urban culture, sportswear, and even high fashion. It's characterized by its casual, yet bold and expressive style, often featuring graphic tees, hoodies, sneakers, and accessories.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Key Elements of Streetwear</h2>
                
                <h3>Graphic Tees</h3>
                <p>Graphic tees are a staple of streetwear, often showcasing bold designs, logos, or cultural references. They allow you to express your personality and make a statement without saying a word. Brands like Supreme, Off-White, and Stüssy are known for their iconic graphic tees.</p>
                
                <h3>Hoodies and Sweatshirts</h3>
                <p>Comfort is king in streetwear, and nothing says comfortable like a cozy hoodie or sweatshirt. Opt for oversized fits and unique prints or embroidery to stand out. Layering hoodies under jackets or over t-shirts can add dimension to your outfit.</p>
                
                <h3>Sneakers</h3>
                <p>Sneakers are arguably the most crucial element of streetwear. High-end collaborations and limited editions are highly coveted. Brands like Nike, Adidas, and Supreme often dominate the scene. Jordans, Yeezys, and Dunks are some of the most sought-after sneaker styles.</p>
                
                <h3>Outerwear</h3>
                <p>From bomber jackets to parkas, outerwear in streetwear is functional yet stylish. Look for pieces with unique cuts, bold colors, or interesting materials. Varsity jackets, puffer jackets, and utility vests are also key pieces in modern streetwear.</p>
                
                <h3>Accessories</h3>
                <p>Accessories can make or break your streetwear outfit. Caps, beanies, bags, and jewelry add that extra flair and complete your look. Rings, chains, and statement sunglasses can elevate a basic outfit. Don't be afraid to experiment with layering and mixing styles.</p>
